# MacMillan_CSCI2270_FinalProject

My project will take in data from the user to create an organized list of grocery items. There will be a struct called item which includes price, amount, item name, and category, and a class called list. All the items will be added to a double-linked list. The user will be prompted for their budject upon running the program and once enough items have been added that they are over the budjet, they will  be notified. There will be methods for adding items, deleting items, comparing prices, applying a coupon (adds to budjet), deleting whole list, deleting everything within a category, add/edit name of list, check remaining budjet, edit budget, and display list.
